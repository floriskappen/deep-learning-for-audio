# Genre classification

This directory contains various approaches to genre classification as well as processing of the (GTZAN Dataset - Music Genre Classification)[https://www.kaggle.com/andradaolteanu/gtzan-dataset-music-genre-classification] dataset.

The files in the directory `2_model/` only work after the data has been processed. The data can be downloaded from the above link, extracted, and put in the `1_preprocessing/` directory. Then the `preprocess.py` file in that directory can be run. Then a `data.json` will be generated in `2_model/data.json`.
