# Deep Learning with audio demos

This repository contains notes and code written while following [Valerio Valerado's "The Sound of AI" course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMqL5vckiU0&list=PL-wATfeyAMNrtbkCNsLcpoAyBBRJZVlnf).

It is for educational purposes only.

The notes are my own but include screenshots from the videos.
The notes may contain errors.
